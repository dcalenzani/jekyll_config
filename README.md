# jekyll_config
Basic Jekyll config file since Github depracated the theme chooser but they maintain it in their marketing page instructions. Took me a while to be able to implement themes correctly since I didn't knew where to search. 

2 big lessons:
- In programming, you cant trust even official pages. Yea, the truth is there in the documentation, but cmon.
- Config files are really important.
